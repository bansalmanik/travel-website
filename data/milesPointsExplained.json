          "Points and miles are loyalty currencies. Airlines, hotels, and banks issue them to reward repeat customers and encourage more spending or bookings.",
          "Despite the name, “miles” are not always based on distance. Many programs award based on ticket price, cabin, or fare type. Similarly, “points” can represent many different types of rewards across banks and hotels.",
          "The key idea: treat them like a special travel-only currency with rules (availability, fees, expirations, and program pricing). They are not equal to cash, and their value changes depending on how you use them."

          "Hotel points: usually best for hotel nights; value varies a lot based on property/season and the program’s pricing model.",
          "Bank (transferable) points: points earned from a bank rewards ecosystem that can often be redeemed either through a portal (like “pay with points”) or transferred to airline/hotel partners. These are powerful because they offer flexibility."

          "Programs often sell points to banks and partners (especially via co-branded cards), which is why card welcome bonuses can be so large and why banks invest heavily in points ecosystems.",
          "This also explains why programs can change: pricing can move, award availability can shrink, and values can drop over time. Flexibility matters."
