Remember to carry your passport and complete the arrival card; immigration procedures are required on both sides of the journey.",
            "We booked a ferry departing at 10:30 AM from Sheung Wan but were able to board the 10:00 AM ferry instead since we arrived early. The ferry terminal is located inside Shun Tak Centre and is directly connected to the Sheung Wan MTR station.",

            "Macau has two primary ferry terminals: Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal and Taipa Ferry Terminal. Almost all major hotels operate complimentary shuttle buses from both terminals, and these shuttles are available even to visitors who are not staying at the hotel. Upon exiting the arrival hall, look for clearly marked shuttle signs for hotels such as Wynn, Venetian, Galaxy, MGM, Sands, and others. Board the shuttle that services the hotel nearest to your destination.",
            "Pro Tip: Most hotels on the Cotai Strip run free shuttles exclusively from the Taipa Ferry Terminal, while hotels in Macau’s city center operate shuttles from the Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal. If you arrive at Taipa but are headed to the city center, take the Lisboa Palace shuttle to Lisboa Palace, then transfer to the Grand Lisboa shuttle which serves central Macau. Shuttle services remain free even if you are not a hotel guest, and staff are generally happy to assist with directions."

Buses connect all major areas — Macau Peninsula, Taipa, Cotai Strip, and Coloane — with frequent service throughout the day. The fare is a flat rate of approximately 6 MOP per ride, regardless of distance, and most major routes run every 5–10 minutes.",
            "Payment can be made in Hong Kong dollars at a 1:1 conversion rate with the Macanese pataca. Board through the front door, place your cash in the fare box, and exit at the rear door when you reach your stop. Keep in mind that no change is provided. If the fare is 6 MOP/HKD and you deposit a 10 HKD note, the remaining amount will not be refunded."

            "We personally used the MT1 route to travel from Grand Lisboa to Taipa Ferry Terminal. Free hotel shuttles were not an option at that time as most services began operating around 10:00–11:00 AM, while we needed to reach the terminal by 10:00 AM."
