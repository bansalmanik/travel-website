Almost all major Macau hotels operate free shuttle buses from ferry terminals and even if you are not a guest you can use them. Walk outside the terminal arrival hall and look for hotel shuttle signage: Wynn, Venetian, Galaxy, MGM, Sands, etc. Board the shuttle for the hotel closest to your destination.",

If you want to travel from Taipa Ferry terminal to Macau City centre first take Lisboa Palace shuttle bus which will drop you at Lisboa Palace. From Lisboa Palace take free shuttle to Grand Lisboa which is in Macau City Centre. And Don't worry shuttle is free even if you are not staying at the respective hotel. Staff at hotel will guide you and almost everyone uses them.'"

Buses connect the major zones — Macau Peninsula, Taipa, Cotai Strip, and Coloane — with frequent services throughout the day. The fare is a simple flat rate of around 6 MOP per ride, regardless of distance. Routes run from early morning until late night, with most tourist routes operating every 5-10 minutes.",

Board the bus from front gate, drop your fare in the fare drop box and exit from back gate of bus when you reach your destination. Remember that you will not get any loose change back when you pay in cash. If your fare is 6 MOP/HKD and you only have 10 HKD bill, you will not get 4 HKD back"
