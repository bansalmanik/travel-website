## Morning Coffee & Planning

Morning coffee is sacred, so we lingered over breakfast at the hotel, plotting a one-day blitz of San Francisco. Caffeine in, spirits up.

## Golden Gate Bridge

Uber dropped us short of the Golden Gate Bridge—roads were tied up by a half-marathon so we hoofed it to the viewpoint. The path climbed just enough to count as steady-state cardio, and then…there it was: that first, fire-orange sweep over the blue bay, families jockeying for the perfect frame, the wind happily restyling everyone's hair.

From the lookout we watched cars speeding across the bridge; when we turned back, a U.S. flag snapped in the wind. Below, ferries and small boats stitched trails across the water, with islands hazy in the distance. You can walk the bridge to the other side, but we stayed where the view was best—lingering to watch waves crash on the beach below—before moving on to our next stop.

## Fisherman's Wharf & Ferry Ride

We spent some time in the Golden Gate Gift Shop, an easy walk from the viewpoint. The assistant at shop kindly tipped us off to catch the yellow bus near the shop, which shuttled us to Fisherman's Wharf—straight to the water. The wharf was buzzing: food stalls everywhere and a big Ferris wheel in the background. Still, we decided to do the ferry ride first.

From Pier 39, two routes beckoned—one short loop and one that circles Alcatraz. We chose the latter. On board, the commentary ran the whole way, diving into the history of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz Island. It turned a little somber, but the city skyline from the boat cheered us right back up.

## Lunch at Applebee's

Back on land, with our appetites worked up, we headed to Applebee's for lunch. The food hit the spot: a juicy chicken burger and a tall glass of watermelon juice. Simple. Perfect. We ate while palm trees swayed outside, the bayfront buzzing in the background.

## Hop-On Hop-Off City Tour

For the afternoon, we hopped on a Hop-On Hop-Off bus for a 2.5-hour spin through the city. We rolled past the Tesla office and those exquisite Victorian-era houses, dipped through Chinatown while the earbuds whispered tales of its rough-and-tumble past, and cruised by the Palace of Fine Arts like a postcard come to life.


Lombard Street twisted beneath us in those famous switchbacks, and the ride finally eased us into Union Square, where we grabbed dinner before heading "home" to CitizenM.

## Shopping at Union Square

It was a joyride—tight, tidy, and totally doable in a day. If you're here for sightseeing, one day works. If you're here to shop—and Union Square tempts hard with names like Macy's and Hermès—you'll want an extra day (or two) to roam.

**Pro tip:** If you're planning to shop, allocate at least an extra day. Union Square's flagship stores deserve more than a quick browse!
