## What Are Credit Card Rewards?

Credit card rewards are incentives offered by credit card companies to encourage card usage. Every time you make a purchase, you earn rewards that can be redeemed for travel, cashback, gift cards, or other benefits.

## Types of Rewards

### Points
Flexible currency that can be transferred to airline and hotel partners or used to book travel through the card's portal.

**Best for:** Travelers who want flexibility

### Miles
Airline-specific currency earned with co-branded cards. Usually redeemed for flights with that airline or partners.

**Best for:** Loyal customers of specific airlines

### Cashback
Simple percentage back on purchases, typically 1-5% depending on category.

**Best for:** Those who prefer simplicity and cash value

## How Earning Works

### Base Earning Rate
Most cards offer 1 point per rupee spent on general purchases.

### Bonus Categories
Higher earning rates (2-5x) on specific categories:
- Travel bookings
- Dining
- Groceries
- Gas stations
- Online shopping

### Sign-Up Bonuses
Large point bonuses (often 50,000-100,000 points) for meeting minimum spending requirements within the first few months.

## Understanding Value

### Points Valuation
Not all points are equal. Typical values:
- Transfer partners: 0.5-2 rupees per point
- Travel portals: 0.3-0.5 rupees per point
- Cashback: 0.25-0.5 rupees per point

### Maximizing Value
- Transfer to airline/hotel partners for best value
- Book premium cabin flights
- Look for transfer bonuses
- Use during off-peak periods

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Choose Your First Card
Consider:
- Annual fee vs. benefits
- Earning categories matching your spending
- Sign-up bonus value
- Redemption flexibility

### Step 2: Meet Minimum Spend
Plan large purchases around sign-up bonus requirements, but never overspend just for points.

### Step 3: Pay in Full
**Critical:** Always pay your full balance. Interest charges negate any rewards earned.

### Step 4: Track and Redeem
Monitor your points balance and plan redemptions for maximum value.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Carrying a Balance
Interest rates (18-36% APR) far exceed any rewards value.

### 2. Overspending
Only spend what you would normally spend. Points aren't worth going into debt.

### 3. Ignoring Annual Fees
Calculate if benefits justify the cost. Sometimes no-fee cards are better.

### 4. Letting Points Expire
Use them or lose them. Most programs have expiration policies.

### 5. Poor Redemptions
Don't redeem for low-value options like merchandise or statement credits when better options exist.

### Year 1: Foundation
- Start with one good card

- Don't treat credit as extra income

## Quick Tips

1. **Start simple** - One good card is better than multiple mediocre ones
2. **Automate payments** - Never miss a due date
3. **Use for planned purchases** - Not impulse buys
