With Axis Bank not accepting new applications for Atlas, the Indian credit card market has a void to fill. Two major contenders have stepped up: the **HSBC Travel One** and the **Axis Horizon**. But which one actually deserves a slot in your wallet?

## 1. Joining Fees & Welcome Benefits

**Cost of Entry**

- **HSBC Travel One:** ₹4,999 + GST (~₹5,899)
  - Fee Waiver: Available on spending ₹8 lakhs annually
- **Axis Horizon:** ₹3,000 + GST (~₹3,540)
  - Fee Waiver: None

**Welcome Benefit**

- **HSBC Travel One:**
  - **Rewards:** ₹1,000 cashback, 3-month EazyDiner Prime membership, and a ₹3,000 Postcard Hotel voucher on spending ₹10,000 in the first 30 days
  - **Limited-Time Offer:** ₹3,999 cashback on spends of ₹25,000 within 30 days
  - **Bonus Reward:** 3,000 bonus points on spending ₹1 lakh in 90 days
  - **Renewal:** None
- **Axis Horizon:**
  - **Rewards:** 5,000 EDGE Miles on the first transaction of ₹1,000+ within 30 days
  - **Renewal:** 1,500 EDGE Miles

**Winner: Axis Horizon**  
Axis Horizon takes this round comfortably. The lower fee, combined with 5,000 EDGE Miles (which are easily worth ₹5,000+ depending on your transfer partner), offers immediate value.

## 2. Reward Rates: The Core Value

This is where the cards truly diverge.

**Base Reward Rate**

- **Axis Horizon:** 2 miles per ₹100 spent
- **HSBC Travel One:** 2 points per ₹100 spent

**Travel Spends (The Real Deal)**

- **Axis Horizon:**
  - **5 EDGE Miles per ₹100 (5% return)** on spending via the *Axis Travel Edge* portal and direct airline websites (MCC-based).
- **HSBC Travel One:**
  - **4 points per ₹100 (4% return)** on spending via OTAs like Cleartrip, Paytm Travel, etc.
  - **Accelerated Rewards:** Up to **16 pts/₹100** on flights and **24 pts/₹100** on hotels when booked via the *HSBC Marketplace*.
  - **Discount Perks:** 15% instant discounts for flight bookings on OTAs (up to ₹5,000).

**Winner: HSBC Travel One**  
While Axis gives a solid 5% on direct bookings, **HSBC Travel One dominates hands down** due to flexibility. Most travelers look for the cheapest deals on aggregators (OTAs), and HSBC rewards you heavily for exactly that behavior. Furthermore, the accelerated reward rate on the HSBC Marketplace is significantly higher than Axis’s offering.

## 3. Redemption & Partners

Both cards offer a robust list of airline and hotel partners. We value both currencies (HSBC Points and Axis EDGE Miles) at **₹1 per point minimum**, as both support 1:1 transfers to major programs.

<Callout type="tip">
**Pro Tip for HSBC Users:** While the HSBC Marketplace offers massive accumulation (earning) rates, never use your points to book flights or hotels directly on the portal. The value is poor. Always transfer your points to airline or hotel partners for maximum value.
</Callout>

## 4. Lounge Access

- **Axis Horizon:**
  - **Domestic:** 8 per quarter (Visa) or 6 per quarter (Mastercard)
  - **International:** 2 per quarter
- **HSBC Travel One:**
  - **Domestic:** 6 per year
  - **International:** 4 per year

**Winner: Axis Horizon**  
If you practically live at airports, Axis Horizon offers significantly more volume. However, for the average traveler taking 1–2 international trips and 2–3 domestic trips a year, HSBC’s limits are sufficient.

## 5. Milestone Benefits

- **Axis Horizon:** None
- **HSBC Travel One:** 10,000 bonus points on spending ₹12 lakhs in a year

## Final Verdict

**Axis Horizon** wins on paper if you only look at the joining fee and lounge access count. It is a “safe” pick, but frankly, it feels like a consolation prize after the discontinuation of the Axis Atlas.

**HSBC Travel One**, however, is the superior financial tool for the actual traveler.

**Why HSBC Travel One Wins:**

- **Higher Returns:** The accelerated rewards on travel spending blow Axis out of the water.
- **Flexibility:** You earn high rewards on OTAs (where flights are often cheaper) rather than being forced onto specific portals.
- **Justified Fee:** Yes, the fee is higher, but if you spend even a moderate amount on travel, the returns far outweigh the cost difference.

## Our Recommendation

If you are looking for a true travel credit card, **HSBC Travel One is the choice**. Ignore the higher upfront fee—the superior reward rate on travel spends makes it the clear winner.
