## Quick Tips

- Only book taxis through the official stand or reputable apps.
- Skip the street charity petitions near major attractions.
- Keep cards in RFID sleeves to avoid quick skimmers.

## Neighborhood Awareness

Montmartre and the area around the Louvre attract pickpockets. Carry a slim cross-body bag and avoid keeping phones in back pockets.
