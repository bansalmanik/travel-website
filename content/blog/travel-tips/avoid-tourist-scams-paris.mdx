## Know the Common Tricks

Fake petitions near monuments, bracelet scams on bridges, and counterfeit taxis at major train stations are the usual suspects.

## Smart Habits

Keep cards and phones in zipped pockets, ignore unsolicited help at ticket machines, and only book tickets from official counters or apps.

## When in Doubt

Call the hotel concierge or use 112 for emergencies. Awareness is the fastest way to disarm opportunistic scammers.
