The Accor Plus membership has rebranded to **ALL Accor+ Explorer**, bringing a fresh set of benefits for travelers in the Asia-Pacific region. If you are sitting on the fence about grabbing this membership, here is a breakdown of what you actually get and, more importantly, whether it makes financial sense for you.

## Benefits Package

**2 "Stay Plus" Nights**

- You get two complimentary night vouchers per year
- These work on a Buy-One-Get-One (BOGO) basis
- You must book a minimum of two nights (one paid + one free) to use a voucher

**Instant Gold Status**

- You are immediately upgraded to Gold Status in the ALL loyalty program
- Benefits include room upgrades and guaranteed room availability

**30% Flat Dining Discount**

- Get a flat 30% off the food bill for up to 10 people
- Valid at participating restaurants across Asia-Pacific

**15% Drinks Discount**

- A consistent 15% off beverages in Asia

## The "Sweetener"

At the time of writing, Accor is throwing in an extra **2,000 Reward Points** if you purchase the membership before **31 December 2025**.

**Value:** These 2,000 points are worth €40 (approx. ₹4,000).

**Why it matters:** This effectively acts as a cashback, significantly lowering the "real" cost of the joining fee.

## Honest Opinion: Who Should Take It?

If you know you will be vacationing in Southeast Asia or the Pacific region (Thailand, Bali, Australia, Vietnam, etc.) over the next year, this membership makes absolute sense.

**Why?**

- The "Stay Plus" BOGO nights are valid specifically across the Asia-Pacific region

**The Math:**

- If you plan a 4-night trip to Phuket or Bali, using your two BOGO vouchers means you effectively pay for 2 nights and stay for 4
- That savings alone usually covers the membership fee

## The Counter Argument: Who Should Skip It?

If you plan to move your credit card points (like Axis EDGE Miles or HDFC Reward Points) to Accor over the next year and you travel on a budget, you might want to pause.

**Why?**

- If you already have enough points to fully cover your Accor stays for the next year, paying cash for this membership might be redundant
- You can simply book your stays using points without being tied to the "Buy One Get One" restriction of the membership voucher

## Final Verdict

The ALL Accor+ Explorer membership is a solid value proposition for the right traveler. If you're planning multiple trips to Southeast Asia or frequently dine at Accor properties, the benefits will easily outweigh the cost.

However, if you're already sitting on a pile of transferable points or don't have firm travel plans, it might be worth waiting until you have a clearer picture of your 2026 travel schedule.

**Bottom line:** This should be a strategic purchase. Calculate your potential savings based on your actual travel plans before committing.
