## Introduction

Airline miles are one of the most valuable travel currencies when used correctly. This guide will show you how to earn miles efficiently and redeem them for maximum value.

## Best Ways to Earn Airline Miles

### Credit Card Sign-Up Bonuses

The fastest way to accumulate miles is through credit card welcome offers. A single card can provide enough miles for a round-trip international flight.

### Everyday Spending

Use airline co-branded cards for:
- Airline purchases (2-5x miles)
- Dining (2-3x miles)
- Gas stations (2x miles)
- General purchases (1x miles)

### Shopping Portals

Earn bonus miles by shopping through airline portals. Stack with credit card rewards for double earning.

### Dining Programs

Register your credit cards with airline dining programs to earn miles at participating restaurants.

## Sweet Spot Redemptions

### Domestic Economy
- Short flights: 7,500-12,500 miles
- Cross-country: 12,500-25,000 miles

### International Economy
- Asia: 35,000-60,000 miles round-trip
- Europe: 30,000-60,000 miles round-trip
- South America: 30,000-50,000 miles round-trip

### Business Class
- Asia: 70,000-120,000 miles round-trip
- Europe: 60,000-100,000 miles round-trip
- Middle East: 80,000-140,000 miles round-trip

## Maximizing Value

### Book in Advance
Award availability is best 11-12 months out for popular routes.

### Be Flexible
Flexibility with dates and routes opens up more award space.

### Use Partner Airlines
Often better availability and value than booking the airline's own flights.

### Avoid Peak Travel
Shoulder season offers better availability and sometimes lower mileage requirements.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Letting miles expire** - Keep accounts active with small transactions
2. **Booking last minute** - Award space is limited close to departure
3. **Ignoring partner airlines** - Often better options than the issuing airline
4. **Not comparing cash vs. miles** - Sometimes cash fares are better value

## Conclusion

With strategic earning and smart redemptions, airline miles can dramatically reduce your travel costs. Start by choosing the right credit cards, then focus on maximizing your redemptions through partner airlines and sweet spot awards.
