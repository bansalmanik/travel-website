## Why It Matters

Air India's fleet refresh makes its loyalty program far more compelling for domestic and long-haul flyers.

## Quick Wins

- Credit Star Alliance partner flights when the earnings chart is favorable
- Watch for seasonal redemption discounts on Gulf and Southeast Asia routes
- Use upgrade vouchers on 787 routes for better cabins

## Partner Strategy

Combine Flying Returns with transferable points for flexibility, and compare with programs like KrisFlyer for the same routes.
