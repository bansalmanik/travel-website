## Travel from Hong Kong to Macau

Two main routes connect Hong Kong to Macau: high-speed ferries from Sheung Wan, and the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge (HZMB) shuttle buses from the airport.

Ferries are a convenient and easy mode of transport. They generally run all year round but suspend service under severe conditions like Typhoon Signal No. 8 or higher. On the other hand, the HZMB bus can be a faster mode of transport late at night when traffic is light, or when there's no other option. There's provision to stow away your luggage safely in both modes of transport, so if you want you can carry your suitcase.

We booked Ferry for 10:30 AM Departure from Sheung Wan but were able to board 10:00 AM ferry because we arrived early. Arriving early can get you on an earlier ferry!

Ferry Terminal is located inside Shun Tak Centre and is well connected with the Sheung Wan MTR station.

Booking can be made online as well as offline. We booked on Klook and everything worked smoothly. Just show QR code of your online booking at the terminal. Remember to bring your passport and a completed arrival card; immigration happens on both sides of the trip.

## Free Shuttle from Ferry Terminal

Macau has two Ferry terminals, Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal and Taipa Ferry Terminal. Almost all major Macau Casino Hotels operate free shuttle buses from ferry terminals and you can use them even if you don't stay at them. Walk outside the terminal arrival hall and look for hotel shuttle signage: Wynn, Venetian, Galaxy, MGM, Sands, etc. Board the shuttle for the hotel closest to your destination. There's also interchange available to different hotels of same Franchise. So if you know your hotels, you can navigate the city for free!

**Free Shuttle Hack:** Most Hotels in Cotai Strip run free shuttle only to Taipa Ferry terminal while Hotels in Macau City Centre run shuttles from Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal. If you want to travel from Taipa Ferry terminal to Macau City centre first take Lisboa Palace shuttle bus which will drop you at Lisboa Palace. From Lisboa Palace take free shuttle to Grand Lisboa which is in Macau City Centre.

And don't worry, as we said, shuttle is free even if you are not staying at the respective hotel. You will easily find an English-speaking staff at hotel who will happily guide you. As everyone uses these shuttles, expect some waiting in line to board these buses.

## Public Buses

Macau's public bus network is extensive, affordable, and one of the best ways to travel if you're comfortable navigating a local system. Buses connect the major zones - Macau Peninsula, Taipa, Cotai Strip, and Coloane - with frequent services throughout the day. The fare is a simple flat rate of around 6 MOP per ride, regardless of distance. Routes run from early morning until late night, with most tourist routes operating every 5-10 minutes.

You can pay for buses in Hong Kong Dollar with 1 Hong Kong Dollar = 1 Macanese Pataca. Board the bus from front gate, drop your fare in the fare drop box and exit from back gate of bus when you reach your destination.
<Callout type="warning">
**Important:** Remember that you will not get any loose change back when you pay in cash. If your fare is 6 MOP/HKD and you only have 10 HKD bill, you will not get 4 HKD back.

## How to Navigate Public Buses

Easiest way to Navigate public buses is using Google Maps. Just open the app and select your destination and google maps will show you where to board the bus and where to deboard it. If your journey involves interchanging buses, map will show you that as well.

At every Bus station in Macau you will see posters which will detail the route of all the buses coming at that stop. You can also refer to Macau Government official web page for bus route information: https://www.dsat.gov.mo/dsat/bus_route.aspx. You can translate this page to English on your web browser.

**Useful Routes:**
- **MT1 bus:** Travel between Taipa Ferry terminal and Macau City Centre (Grand Lisboa or Senardo Square)
- **Bus 28A:** Travel between Cotai Strip and Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal
</Callout>

We used MT1 bus to travel from Grand Lisboa to Taipa Ferry Terminal. The reason free shuttle was not an option for us was because we had to reach terminal at 10:00 AM while the free shuttle started operating from 10:00 - 11:00 AM.

*Read the Route carefully to determine which side of the road you have to board the bus from.*

## Taxi

Taxis are easily available in Macau, but not through Uber app, which doesn't work here. Expect them to be much pricier compared to public transport. We did not use Taxi at all in Macau so cannot provide more information.
