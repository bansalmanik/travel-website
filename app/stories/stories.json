Let’s be honest: desserts were the clear winner—glossy chocolate pastries and dangerously good cinnamon rolls (we lost count of how many of these we ate with zero regrets). Reminder: calories don’t count on vacation—especially when the soft buns and warm rolls are calling. And please, try the chef’s special; skipping it would be passing on a significant life experience.

Below, ferries and small boats stitched trails across the water, with islands hazy in the distance.

From Pier 39, two routes beckoned—one short loop and one that circles Alcatraz. We chose the latter.
