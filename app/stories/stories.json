Let’s be honest: desserts were the clear winner—glossy chocolate pastries and dangerously good cinnamon rolls (we lost count of how many of these we ate with zero regrets). Reminder: calories don’t count on vacation—especially when the soft buns and warm rolls are calling. And please, try the chef’s special; skipping it would be passing on a significant life experience.
