Reminder: calories don’t count on vacation—especially when the soft buns and warm rolls are calling. And please, try the chef’s special; skipping it would be passing on a significant life experience.

Below, ferries and small boats stitched trails across the water, with islands hazy in the distance.

From Pier 39, two routes beckoned—one short loop and one that circles Alcatraz. We chose the latter. On board, the commentary ran the whole way, diving into the history of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz Island.
